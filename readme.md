# cinder-puzzle

A framework for using the powerful [clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/) ASP solving system within the [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/)
creative coding environment. It provides tools for

* loading and solving existing answer set programs
* constructing answer set programs dynamically
* managing solve execution
* parsing the results

## Development

cinder-puzzle links against libclingo and cinder. Build both from sources and place them in cinder-puzzle's parent directory.

## Usage

The API is fluctuated as development continues. Look under `src/demos` for full, up-to-date usage examples.
